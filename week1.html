            <h2>Great Learning Experience</h2>
            <p>This week, our teacher, Miss Aditi Mam, guided us on how to create an e-portfolio. She emphasized the importance of maintaining a professional online presence, especially on platforms like LinkedIn. We learned how LinkedIn is a fantastic tool for connecting with professionals and building our personal brand.</p>
            <p>She also took us through the process of introducing ourselves effectively. We had an interactive session where we learned how to present ourselves confidently, which is a vital skill in both professional and personal life. Her tips were very practical and helped us to refine our self-introduction.</p>
