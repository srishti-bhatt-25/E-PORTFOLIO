            <h2>Great Self Introspection</h2>
            <p>This week, I had an excellent experience in self-introspection. We were asked to answer 16 questions that made us reflect on our strengths, weaknesses, and how we see ourselves. This was an eye-opening exercise that helped me understand my personal growth areas better.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we participated in a fun activity where we passed a book around, and when the music stopped, the person holding the book had to come up on stage and perform what was written on a chit. It was a simple task, but it was meant to help build confidence and involve everyone in the activity. It was a great way to break the ice and get everyone comfortable with public speaking.</p>
